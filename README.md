# Learning Go

Welcome to my journey of learning Go! This repository documents my progress as I explore the Go programming language.

## About Go

Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed by Google. It's designed for simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency, making it a popular choice for building scalable and reliable software systems.

## Goals

- **Master the Basics**: Start with the fundamentals of Go programming, including syntax, data types, control structures, and functions.
- **Explore Advanced Concepts**: Dive deeper into advanced topics like concurrency, interfaces, error handling, and package management.
- **Build Projects**: Apply what I learn by working on practical projects to reinforce my understanding and skills (coming soon).
- **Contribute to Open Source/Community**: Contribute to open-source Go projects and collaborate with the vibrant Go community  ([London Gophers](https://gophers.london/), [Gopher Slack](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/general/)).

## Resources

- **Official Documentation**: [Go Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/), [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) and [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/go).
- **Online Courses**: Here are some courses I've done or am planning on doing [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-golang), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/), and [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/go).

## Progress

- Week 1: Getting Started with Go
- Week 2: Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go
- Week 3: Concurrency in Go
- Week 4+: Coding tasks/challenges
